# What-is-the-purpose-of-modest-swimwear-

To provide greater coverage of the body against traditional swimwear, while allowing for women's involvement in water sports, modest bathing suits have been designed. 

Women prefer to wear modest swimwear and follow a strict Islamic or cultural tradition that requires more cover. By providing more coverage, modest swimwear can help women feel more comfortable and confident while swimming, and can also help protect the skin from harmful UV rays from the sun.

Additionally, modest swimwear can provide a way for women to participate in water activities without compromising their personal beliefs or values. Overall, the purpose of modest swimwear is to offer women a more conservative and modest option for enjoying water activities, while still providing them with comfort, versatility, and protection.

With its fashionable design and commitment to quality, the Alanna Maria has quickly become a popular choice for women around the world.
